            - 6-month long internship as part of the curicullum.
            <br />
            - Worked with the team Intelligent Data lakes at the India
            Development Center of Informatica Solution Pvt. Ltd - the world's
            leading company in data enterprise management headquartered in
            Redwood City, California.
            <br />
            - Being at the ideation and initial development phase of this data
            warehousing product, I developed and tested the two major services
            related to metadata management and data ingestion in the lake.
            <br />
            - I got the opportunity to benchmark the product requirements by
            independently researching into the concept of data lakes.
            <br />
            - With the guidance of my college professor-mentor, I presented the
            team with gaps and required enhancements in the then current
            featuring of the product which helped me in understand the
            prototyping and road mapping of the products.
            <br />
            - My initiative of going out of the way and visualizing the product
            with a fresh perspective to come up with meticulous insights proved
            valuable to them.

            - Analytics dashboard for "Trending Apps", a widget shipped in
            multiple phones manufactures by original equipment manufacturers
            such as Micromax, Karbonn. I designed a scalable web panel for the
            clients to track real-time user activity on the mobile widget to
            enhance their value-added services and more effective targeted
            marketing. The scalability was a great concern and therefore I chose
            Django REST framework for the backed and Highcharts library for the
            front end. The user base of those apps went from 0.2 M 2014 to 5M in
            2015.
            <br />
            - Marketing Intelligence metric: Developed a panel for the
            enterprises to analyzing their competitors move by giving them
            visualization on the dashboard, timely alerts and also generating
            relevant reports. This product was showcased in the VAS Asia
            conference 2014.

            phones manufactures by original equipment manufacturers such as
            Micromax, Karbonn. I worked on Content-based Recommendation Systems
            to rank and recommend the rights applications from the play store to
            be populated in the catalog widget. This was done by involved
            extracting features from descriptions of the applications on the
            play store using tf-idf technique and classifying on the basis of
            cosine similarity.

            In this project, I designed a new programming language construct and
            implemented its compiler. I designed a general-purpose language for
            the Internet of Things (IoT) by adding features to the existing
            programming languages. It was a 4-month long project where we
            implemented lexer, parser, abstract syntax tree and code generator
            for the same.
