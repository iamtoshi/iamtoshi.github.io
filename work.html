                      At Flipkart, I have built several features using React Native and TypeScript/JavaScript to independently build features on all the mobile platforms. By the virtue of React Native and React Native for Web we are able to reuse a great chunk of code among the platforms. Introducing interface approach to create common contracts between the platforms and writing a single piece of code that gets bundled to be replaced in each of the platform's application.

                      Via the contracts of the Cross-platform interface, the common feature code gets bundled and fetched on the three different native platforms. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Coming across the goodness of React Native, I with my team, quickly adopted this tech stack and started building applications. As my learnings gained momentum, I built a complete membership program by writing the code once in TypeScript and for the very first time, this framework was running seamlessly over the widgetized data responses. This journey was very challenging but the outcomes were worth the efforts.
                      At Flipkart, we now reuse almost 70% of our code written in TypeScript and using React Native.

            <p>As a core member of the UI team for cart, checkout, and payments at Flipkart, I built various user-centric flows on this funnel. 
            <span id="dots1">...</span>
                  <span id="more1">
                      These pages of an e-commerce product are the most crucial ones and any discrepancy here leads to the user dropping out and therefore a loss for the company. This flow should be seamless, bug-free and without many distractions. Therefore, to keep these pages independent of the app releases on mobile are made on webviews with code written in JS (React), so that as and when required releases can be made by just deploying the JS bundles. 

                      I developed a no. of features on this funnel mostly centered towards improving user flows in order to solve for cross-selling via recommendations, logistics by avoiding bad addresses and many more. Some of my projects that helped me learn a lot about Indian users and the challenges posed by them are as follows :

 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <span style="font-weight:bold">1. Address Intelligence System</span>
 <br>
The problem in hand :
<br>

Users adding wrong addresses (city, pin code, state, street combinations) which are not filtered before the order is placed. T

Users adding incomplete and absurd (unacceptable) addresses which become a logistic pain point after the complete order has been managed and is out for delivery

Users not understanding English type their addresses in other languages which is again considered a bad address by our system.  

 
<br>
The solution:
<br>
Introducing a data backed up, leaned system that suggests in case it is an absurd or unacceptable address i.e. case of monkey typing.

Corrects user in case of the wrong combination of pin code, street, city or state.

While user adds a new address or edits an existing address, an option is given to "Use My location" in order to autofill the location and lower the chances of the wrong address.

  Using current location as prominent features helps people not very comfortable in a particular vernacular.

The results and learnings:

A very interesting learning, after the experiment ran for 3 months, was that initially, the percentage of conversions to successful payments dropped due to the blockages showed by the system to the user. But in the long run, this helped logistics a great deal as most of the addresses that reach the order management system were legitimate.

"Use my Location" as a feature worked very well. The order summary to payments conversion increased to ~10% (1.18 bps increase). Given someone selected a Use My Location construct, we were able to convert users 82% of the time. The corollary, 82% of UML users get a pre-filled address at the time of checkout, thereby increasing their chances of conversion.

Very important learning from the user experience perspective was that users expect uninterrupted experience, so showing the minimum number of pop-ups at the right time was the key to the success of this product. 
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">2. Recommendation features from cross-selling/bundle offer on Cart/Checkout </span>     
<br>
The opportunity in hand :
<br>
While on the final step of purchasing a product on the application, users are at the best place to make a choice of purchasing a subsidiary or complementary product instantly, for instance, phone cover or an extended warranty with a phone. This also included giving users the option to check any offers that are available on their payment modes or bulk purchase upfront and showing the available offers on similar products if purchased together.
<br>
The solution :
<br>
I built the user experience for :
<br>
1. Giving recommendations to the user while showing the items in the cart (attached just below the product) and also displaying any discounts available then and there. 
<br>
2. Giving subtle callouts of bundled offers at the right places also increases the chances of users showing intent on buying bulk products.
<br>
The learning:
<br>
The overall learning from building all these experiences and putting them under AB experiments resulted in an increase in the cross-sell purchases as well as bundled purchases. Just the key to all of these exercises is not distracting the user from the main intention i.e. buying the products added in the cart.
